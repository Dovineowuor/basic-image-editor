# Basic Image Editor application
The Basic Image Editor application implements few basic image processing operations in python. The application provides an easy to use GUI built on PyQt4 to perform these operations on grayscale and colour images, and is completely implemented in Python. The operations performed on color images were limited to the V channel in HSV format. 

The operations implemented are:
* Histogram computation
* Histogram equalization
* Gamma correction
* Log transform
* Image negative
* Blurring
* Sharpening
* Basic edge detection

A screenshot of the application is given below.
